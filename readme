about
-----------

a tutorial about how to use setuptools in python for dependancies mgnmt.

** this only covers a SINGLE module, not using submodule in it (this is next step) **

* using `this <https://python-packaging-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setup_py.html>`_ as a tutorial
* starting with the above for example
* as a next step, a more involved & opinionated setup is described `here <https://blog.ionelmc.ro/2014/05/25/python-packaging/>`_
    * that contains interesting points but it's way too advanced for my needs right now

installation & usage
-------------------------
* cd to pysetuptools root
* pip install .
* then similar to dev mode (but live changes won't be effective until there's a rebuild)

in devlopment mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* cd to pysetuptools root project directory
* `pip install -e ./`
* `demo_script.py`
* can also use `bash_run` (shows how to just have a callable instead)

walkthrough
----------------
* putting a number of things I won't use right now - but just to have a decent base structure to work with
* we've chosen to go with the /package/test structure. other do things differently. the advanced example liked above prefers a flat `/src, /test, setup.py` kind of layout.

technologies
-----------------
* using setuptools (extension of distutils)
